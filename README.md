﻿# GorillaSource  
A mod for Gorilla Tag porting bunny hopping from GoldSrc and Source engines.

---

## ❓ What is GorillaSource?

**GorillaSource** is a movement-enhancing mod for **Gorilla Tag** that faithfully recreates the **bunny hopping mechanics** from classic Valve engines like **GoldSrc** (Half-Life, CS 1.6) and **Source** (CS:GO, TF2). If you're a fan of precise, fluid movement and skill-based traversal, this mod brings that same energy to virtual reality.
